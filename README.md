# How to install

Go to the [releases page of this repo](https://github.com/mcdado/tota11yps/releases) and download the latest zip file and upload it to your PrestaShop online store, or your local installation.

# Usage

After installing from the Back Office, you can choose to link directly to the library file on the master branch on GitHub. This allows you to always use the latest version, but requires an internet connection. For local offline testing, it is useful to use the embedded option.
